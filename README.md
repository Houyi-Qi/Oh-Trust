## üîë Core Modules

1. **BiN_CDO** (Contract-based Futures Trading)  
   - Implements candidate generation, best contract selection, and execution under demand uncertainty.  
   - Aligns with the *ConFutures baseline*.  

2. **BiN_TCD** (Task-based Spot Trading)  
   - Implements spot-stage settlement and ConSpot baseline.  

3. **SRU_ConR** (Smart Reputation Update & Reward)  
   - Execution-driven reputation monitoring after each long-term contract.  
   - Provides reward function consistent with the paper.  
   - Includes **DDQN agent** implementation.  

4. **OhTrust**  
   - Integrates BiN_CDO, BiN_TCD, and SRU_ConR.  
   - Defines environment states `[demand, total_utility, NI, reputation]`.  
   - Supports actions:  
     - `0 = Renew` (renegotiate contract)  
     - `1 = Execute` (futures + spot execution)  
   - Trains an agent via **DDQN** and saves the best model.

## üìä Dataset

We use the **Chicago Taxi dataset (2013‚Äì2016)**, available from the  
[Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew).  

From the raw CSV, we extract:
- **Taxi ID**  
- **Trip Start Timestamp**  
- **Pickup Community Area**  

Then filter **Community Area 77**, and group by `(TaxiID, Date)` to count daily trips (**NumTrips**).  
Rolling statistics over 30 days provide historical demand bounds \(\hat{n}_i\) and \(\tilde{n}_i\).

## üöÄ Usage

### Run Oh-Trust training
```bash
python OhTrust.py
```

This will:
- Train DDQN agent on the Oh-Trust environment.  
- Save the best model to:
  ```
  ohtrust_ddqn_best.pt
  ```

### Run baselines
```bash
python Random.py
python ConFutures.py
python ConSpot.py
python HybridFS.py
```

## üìà Output

Each run reports **four main indicators**:

- `ESP_Utility`  
- `MU_Utility`  
- `FinishTaskNum`  
- `NI`  

Example output:
```json
{
  "method": "XXXXX",
  "ESP_Utility": 1111,
  "MU_Utility": 2222,
  "FinishTaskNum": 3333,
  "NI": 4444
}
```

Additional metrics (e.g., VoRM, TRLC, UoR) are available in code but not included in default outputs.

## üìù Notes

- **Œ± (Pr_alpha)**: For minimal reproducibility, Œ± is simplified here. In practice, Œ± should be **data-driven**, estimated from empirical demand distributions. An extension interface is provided in `Pr.py`.  
- Reputation is updated **after each futures contract execution**, consistent with SRU_ConR.  
- Outputs are aligned with paper definitions: ESP utility, MU utility, finished tasks, and NI count.  
- This repository only releases **core modules and baselines** for peer review reproducibility.
